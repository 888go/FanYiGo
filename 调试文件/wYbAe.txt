// ErrDot indicates that a path lookup resolved to an executable
// in the current directory due to ‘.’ being in the path, either
// implicitly or explicitly. See the package documentation for details.
//
// Note that functions in this package do not return ErrDot directly.
// Code should use errors.Is(err, ErrDot), not err == ErrDot,
// to test whether a returned error err is due to this condition.
